# C# Fundamental Assignemnt 1

Practice fundamental C#

It's been a minute since I practiced C#, it's not at all exactly like Db (#MuscianHumor), though it does feel like Java.
The requirements for this first assignment are below. I enjoy getting back to code that looks like code, after all that frontend stuff. :-)

## Requirements

Navigate to file Program.cs and provide logics for following function:

1. Complete function `toTitleCase` to convert an English string to title case, not using any library. For example, string: “this is a text” => “This Is A Text”
2. Complete function `matrixMultiply` to multiply 2 matrices of integer numbers

## My conclusions
Matrices were never my strongpoint, but I happily rely on the advice of others.
